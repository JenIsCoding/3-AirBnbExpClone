[Build an AirBnb Experiences Clone](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?t=8846)

Create a clone of AirBnb Experiences pages with React.

*Concepts*: In this section, we're focusing on React's Props, a convenient method that allows us to use data (often, the data are given in the form of JS objects or arrays) to create repetitive structures but with different text or images every time. Props are the link between React and dynamic websites.
